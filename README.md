# 🧠 Planning AI Agent — With and Without Knowledge Base

This repository showcases a Planning-based AI Agent implemented in two approaches:
- ✅ **With a Knowledge Base (KB)**
- ❌ **Without a Knowledge Base (KB)**

Both notebooks demonstrate how intelligent agents can plan actions in goal-oriented environments using rule-based and non-rule-based logic.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- 📜 **Declarative AI** approach using predicates and operators.
- 🧩 **Goal Formulation**, **Action Planning**, and **State Transitions**.
- 🧠 Knowledge-based agent using a formal logic structure (with KB).
- 🔄 Procedural-style agent operating without a dedicated KB.
